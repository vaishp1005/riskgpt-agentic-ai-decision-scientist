## **Overview**

RiskGPT is an advanced agentic AI system that performs high-precision uncertainty modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, and market-grade financial analytics across personal, business, and stock-market decisions.
This project blends decision science, quantitative modeling, and agent architectures into a unified engine capable of:

1. Multi-domain risk assessment
2. Simulation-driven forecasting
3. Agentic adaptation using PAOR loops
4. Deep market intelligence (RELIANCE 2010–2025 dataset)
5. Automated BUY/HOLD/AVOID classification

### **Capstone Project (Google + Kaggle)**

This project originated as part of the Google AI Agents Intensive — Freestyle Track (2025), demonstrating:

1. Agentic reasoning

2. Multi-domain simulation

3. Financial analytics

4. End-to-end uncertainty modeling

It has since been significantly expanded and refined into a research-level system suitable for real-world applications.

## Future Work & Roadmap

Although RiskGPT is fully functional, the following upgrades would transform it into a production-grade decision intelligence system:

### 1. Integrate a real Gemini-powered agent chain
- Use Gemini models to generate reasoning traces
- Connect analysis modules through tool-calling
- Add explanation and audit logs using agent traces

### 2. Deploy as an API (FastAPI + Cloud Run)
- Containerize the core engine
- Host a lightweight inference endpoint
- Enable external applications to send scenarios to RiskGPT

### 3. Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit + Plotly)
- Live interactive simulations
- Adjustable risk profile sliders
- Visual Monte Carlo explorer
- Real-time stock comparison widgets

### 4. Reinforcement Learning for Market Decisions
- Train an RL agent using historical returns
- Compare performance vs Monte Carlo agent
- Integrate risk-adjusted reward functions

### 5. Multi-Agent Portfolio Optimization System
- Separate agents for risk modeling, asset selection, and allocation
- Use agents to negotiate trade-offs among volatility, drawdown, and returns
- Extend beyond single-stock intelligence to NIFTY50-level portfolios

This roadmap reflects the long-term vision of evolving RiskGPT from a notebook prototype into an intelligent, agent-driven financial research platform.
